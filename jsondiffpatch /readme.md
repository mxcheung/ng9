ngx-text-diff.module.d.ts(1, 22): This likely means that the library (ngx-text-diff) which declares NgxTextDiffModule is not compatible with Angular Ivy.
Check if a newer version of the library is available, and update if so.
Also consider checking with the library's authors to see if the library is expected to be compatible with Ivy.
